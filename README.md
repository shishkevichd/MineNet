1. Clone this git
2. Go to Server folder and move **MineNet.js** and **dependencies** folder to **plugins** folder
3. Configure the plugin. To do this, go into MineNet.js and change the line `worldName: 'Server'` to the name of your world (the name can be found by going to **worlds** folder)
4. (Optional) Install Python (3.6.x-3.9.x) and in terminal enter `pip install flask`, so **Flask** is set globally
5. Run server.

# Waning

- The program require installed **Flask**. To install Flask, type `pip install flask`
